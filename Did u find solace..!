Its time dear soul,
paint out yourself!
Its time dear soul,
pour out the story unheard for years!
Its time dear soul,
cry out loud in joy!
Its time dear soul,
spill out the deepest desires unrelished!
Its time dear soul,
gush out your love, your pain,
your agony that's been living with you till!

Its time dear soul,
Didn't you find Solace?
Speak out dear soul, and you will find peace within.
