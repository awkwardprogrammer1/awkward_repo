The Rupenzel (her feel) or might be true even the women with whom evryone "Well behaves" :-P:-P

Makes the surface as slippery as possible with so much of hardwork put in and still to be clear so much of "own work" put in. The living legendary and true inspiration for freshers.

The maa saraswathi whos dreams are conquered by the deployment issues. the always polite, humble and the talented little being  :-) :-P

Puts in lot of zeal in analysing how things work, and never bothers to be noticed, shows concern and tries to maintain democracy in the team :-D :D

Calm and subtle, (the captain cool types) we are done with our part, aage jo bhi hoga dekhe jayega types. and not to forget the traditional lady of CEE :P

Who is soooper hyper active multitalented be it the TR solving, singing, dancing(in bus) :P, throwball(The lady boss of CEE)

The coding geek of CEE :-P does evrything in his own way (doesnt fear for any) does anything only if he want to. try forcing and get the zero output!! :D

The mood swing lady of CEE? into her own world.. seldom disturbed by a tall bearded man(may be frend) :-P:-P

The two jaan jigris of CEE ..... tere bin nahi laage jiya types (for this think little bit high in soaping n little bit low in content)

The silent one only the lucky ears got to hear her.

Will be winning awesome voice award.. if there's any..

When CEE is ashes, you have my permission to die.

The perfect one who come ontime and leaves ontime.

There's one often in a hurry to finish the work right n head home, has a kinda pendrive(memory device) inserted in the brain, stays focussed with the task n often a kid who takes silly things to heart??
